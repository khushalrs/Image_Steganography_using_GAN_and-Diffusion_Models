# Image Steganography using Diffusion and GAN Models

This repository contains the code and resources for my final year capstone project, completed as part of my bachelor's degree. The project focuses on **image steganography**, utilizing cutting-edge **diffusion** and **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)** deep learning models to achieve secure and efficient data hiding within images.

## Overview

Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another medium, such as embedding a secret message inside an image. This project explores advanced techniques in the field by leveraging the power of diffusion processes and GANs to enhance the robustness and imperceptibility of hidden data.

### Key Features
- **Diffusion Model:** Utilizes a diffusion process to incrementally alter pixel values, making the hidden data less detectable.
- **GAN Model:** Implements a GAN architecture to improve the quality of the steganographic images, ensuring the hidden data remains undetected by adversarial attacks.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines both diffusion and GAN techniques to maximize the security and quality of the steganographic images.

## Abstract
In our increasingly digital world, the demand for secure and discreet communication methods has never been greater. This project presents an
innovative solution for secure message transmission by harnessing the power of image steganography along with generative adversarial networks and diffusion models. 
Our approach involves the forward diffusion of a concealed image into a cover image, allowing for the covert transmission of sensitive 
information between devices. When the concealed image is retrieved, it can be seamlessly reverse-diffused to reveal the hidden message. 
This method not only guarantees the confidentiality of the transmitted data but also preserves the visual integrity of the cover image, 
making it an effective and imperceptible means of secure communication in an era marked by heightened digital security concerns
